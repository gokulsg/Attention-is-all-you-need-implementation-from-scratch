About the Project:
data:
    This folder contains the dataset used in this project. I have tried with two datasets: 1) PHP dataset (Eng to Ger) and 
    2) News commentry dataset(v15) [Since this dataset is very large, I have used only 40,000 records]. The dataset is downloaded from
    https://data.statmt.org/news-commentary/v15/.

    # PHP dataset #
    Train - 10281
    Test - 1000
    Valid - 1000

    # News commentry dataset #
    Train - 36,000
    Test - 2000
    Valid - 2000

    German vocabulary - 27403
    English vocabulary - 17266

For implementation of this code:

    python main.py

[The hyperparameters values can be changed from main.py file]

For calculating BLEU Score uncomment the last two line of main.py file
The BLEU Score I got for news commentry dataset is : 14.8

For Data preperation, use python Data_Prep.py and python Data_Prep_php.py (The pre-processed dataset is provided in the data folder)
Few Translations outputs of the model are provided in output.txt file
